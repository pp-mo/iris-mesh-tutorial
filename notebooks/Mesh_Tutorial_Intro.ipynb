    "## Important Preliminary : use + stability of notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "A good deal of the content relies on code which is still experimental.\n",
    "We must expect that there are various outstanding problems, and things sometimes crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular problem is getting things working *within notebooks*.  For that purpose, the following may be useful general notes :\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python environment\n",
    "When opening a notebook, you may be **prompted** to select the Python environment with which to run it (which must contain Iris, Jupyter, PyVista etc).  \n",
    "We suggest that you launch the Jupyter server _itself_ in the dedicated (conda) tutorial env.  Then you can simply use the _same_ env as the server, i.e. select \"`Python 3 (ipykernel)`\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### When something seems to be taking a long time with no result...\n",
    "   1. ***first*** look at \"kernel status\" in top-right of the JupyterLab notebook pane  \n",
    "       meanings as described in its mouse-over text : \n",
    "       * white circle = \"idle\" (ok, done)\n",
    "       * grey circle = \"busy\"\n",
    "       * \"electric zap\" icon = \"connecting\"  ***-- this one often means \"crashed\"***\n",
    "   2. if stuck, you can always \"restart the kernel\"  \n",
    "      (the arrow-round-a-circle icon, in controls at top left of notebook pane)  \n",
    "      but note :\n",
    "        1. this will destroy the entire session :  you need to rerun all notebook cells from the start again\n",
    "        2. after resetting, **do not attempt anything further** until the kernel state shows \"idle\" again\n",
    "   3. sometimes gets *really* stuck  \n",
    "      -- e.g. after restart, kernel status persists in \"connecting\" / \"restarting\" state  \n",
    "      In such cases, *close* the JupyterLab window + restart\n",
    "      * i.e. `$ jupyter-lab`"
